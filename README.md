# Discord Webhook Announcer
A simple program that let's you send messages on Discord through Webhooks.

## IMPORTANT: Webhook Migration
In June 2020, Discord has migrated their website from "discordapp.com" to "discord.com". At the moment, all requests going to "discordapp.com" are still handled, however this will no longer be the case after November 7, 2020. At that point, all webhooks containing the old domain in their URL will cease to work unless each one of them is edited individually, and with this tool you can migrate all of your saved webhooks to the new domain with just a few clicks.
The tool can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kowalski7/k7-database/master/toolbox/DWH%20Migration%20Utility.exe).

## Features
- Customization: Customize the username and profile picture of your webhook.
- Profiles: Store multiple webhook configurations and switch between them with ease.
- Instant webhook preview: See how your webhook looks the moment you paste it's link. You can also see the changes as you make them.
- Discord-like UI: The program looks similar to Discord and it uses the same font. Also, it uses the dark theme. :)

## Download
You can download the program from [here](https://github.com/Kowalski7/Discord-Webhook-Announcer/releases).
This program does not require any installation. Just place it wherever you want and run it.

## Profiles storage location
All of the profiles are stored in a subdirectory named 'profiles'. It will be automatically created in the same folder as the main executable and the profiles will use the extension '.dwh'. Since all data made by the program is stored in the same directory as the program itself, it can also be put on a flash drive and used to make announcements on the go.
